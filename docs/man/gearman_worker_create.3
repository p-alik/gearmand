.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
gearman_worker_create() is used to create a \fBgearman_worker_st\fP  structure that will then
be used by other libgearman(3) client functions to communicate with the server. You
should either pass a statically declared \fBgearman_worker_st\fP  to gearman_worker_create() or
a NULL. If a NULL passed in then a structure is allocated for you.
.sp
\fBgearman_worker_clone()\fP is similar to \fBgearman_worker_create()\fP but it copies the
defaults and list of servers from the source \fBgearman_worker_st\fP. If you pass a null as
the argument for the source to clone, it is the same as a call to gearman_worker_create().
If the destination argument is NULL a \fBgearman_worker_st\fP  will be allocated for you.
.sp
To clean up memory associated with a \fBgearman_worker_st\fP  structure you should pass
it to \fBgearman_worker_free()\fP when you are finished using it. \fBgearman_worker_free()\fP is
the only way to make sure all memory is deallocated when you finish using
the structure.
.sp
You may wish to avoid using \fBgearman_worker_create()\fP or \fBgearman_worker_clone()\fP with a
stack based allocation, ie the first parameter. The most common issues related to ABI safety involve
heap allocated structures.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.sp
\fBgearman_worker_create()\fP returns a pointer to the \fBgearman_worker_st\fP that was created
(or initialized). On an allocation failure, it returns NULL.
.sp
\fBgearman_worker_clone()\fP returns a pointer to the \fBgearman_worker_st\fP that was created
(or initialized). On an allocation failure, it returns NULL.
